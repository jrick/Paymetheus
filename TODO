RPC/dcrwallet:

- New gRPC APIs to:
  - purchase tickets
  - anything else?
- Update existing messages for stake related fields (cj has full list)
- No recovery if previous process was killed and didn't get a chance to stop
  the dcrwallet process.  Possible solutions are killing any dcrwallet
  already running (hate!) or perhaps rigging the gRPC server in dcrwallet
  to close the process after the client disconnects, but no idea if this
  is possible.
- Need to run dcrwallet gRPC server on different ports to not interfere with
  a typical dcrwallet install

Model/ViewModel:

- Don't save every transaction in memory (can fix post-release)
- Imported account is already hidden since it will be removed in a later
  dcrwallet release.  Decide if this needs to be displayed in first release
  or not.
- Fee estimation needs to be ported (partially completed in a btcsuite
  Paymetheus PR: https://github.com/btcsuite/Paymetheus/pull/44).
- Add viewmodel for history
- Add viewmodel for unspent outputs
- Remove all MessageBox usage, hook up everything to display in the Shell
  view instead
- Wallet seed word list encoding needs extra word at end for checksum to
  match dcrwallet.  I kinda hate this format and don't want to display
  it when creating a new wallet (one byte of checksum is not enough, the PGP
  word list already catches missing words, and there should be extra data in
  the seed for when it was created), but we should at least not bail out when
  decoding a seed created by other dcr tools.
- Would be nice to make Paymetheus.Decred a PCL again (Paymetheus.Bitcoin is
  in the btcsuite version), currently impossible because BlakeSharp requires
  the older .NET cryptographic libraries (low prio for windows, but may be
  necessary for portability on other platforms).
- Some address/script functionality is not yet implemented.  Search for
  NotImplementedException.

View:

- Time since last block has no binding and there is no easy way to access
  this yet for blocks already processed before starting the wallet.
  Might be wise to remove this in the first release.
- Should default to opening the overview frame
- "sent" and "received" amounts in overview need to go, wallet does
  not track them and it would be more useful to put something like
  "locked" for those who stake
- Need a textbox-like control for inputing amounts, to use in create
  transaction view.
- Add pending output button in create transaction view is not functional
- There is no way to remove pending outputs yet, each item should contain
  a button for removing itself from the ObservableCollection.
- Request view doesn't hide UI elements depending on whether a generated
  address is shown yet or not
- Some text is too small, make it bigger
- In create transaction view, the type of output needs to be selectable
  (such as paying to a raw script instead of an address), viewmodel already
  supports this.
- Still lots of hardcoded positions with margins in the new views.  These
  need to be repositioned relative to other objects (using Grid, StackPanel,
  DockPanel, Border, etc.)
- Way too much duplicated xaml all over the place
- Bindings for history
- Bindings for unspent outputs
- Input controls that require validation should have visual indicators
  for when entered data is invalid (especially important for the create
  transaction view).
- Block hash of current block is no where to be found.  For desktop (mouse)
  users it might be adequate to use a tooltip over the block height, but
  this is a bad solution to those with touch screens.
