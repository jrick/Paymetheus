RPC/dcrwallet:

- New gRPC APIs to:
  - purchase tickets
  - anything else?
- Update existing messages for stake related fields (cj has full list)
- No recovery if previous process was killed and didn't get a chance to stop
  the dcrwallet process.  Possible solutions are killing any dcrwallet
  already running (hate!) or perhaps rigging the gRPC server in dcrwallet
  to close the process after the client disconnects, but no idea if this
  is possible.
- Need to run dcrwallet gRPC server on different ports to not interfere with
  a typical dcrwallet install

Model/ViewModel:

- [required] Add viewmodel for history
- [required] Fee estimation needs to be ported (partially completed in a
  btcsuite Paymetheus PR: https://github.com/btcsuite/Paymetheus/pull/44) or
  added to the RPC API.  Right now all estimated fees when constructing
  transactions are displayed as 0.
- [required] Some address/script functionality (in
  Paymetheus.Decred.Script.OutputScript and Paymetheus.Decred.Wallet.Address)
  is not yet implemented.  This can cause application crashes when trying to
  parse these scripts/addresses when decoding raw transactions returned by
  the wallet. Search these classes for NotImplementedException.
- [required] Wallet seed word list encoding needs extra word at end for
  checksum to match dcrwallet.  I kinda hate this format and don't want to
  display it when creating a new wallet (one byte of checksum is not enough,
  the PGP word list already catches missing words, and if there is any extra
  data added it should be some kind of timestamp or blockheight of when the
  seed was generated), but we should at least not bail out when decoding a
  seed created by other dcr tools.
- [required] Imported account is currently hidden since it will be removed
  in a later dcrwallet release.  Decide if this needs to be displayed in
  first release or not (how soon can it be fixed in dcrwallet?).  Importing
  to other (BIP0044) accounts is currently unsupported so without the
  imported account, all key imports are impossible.
- [post-release] Add viewmodel for unspent outputs
- Validation of user input in the startup dialogs would be nice (instead
  of opening a message box with parse errors when trying to continue).
- Don't save every transaction in memory (can fix post-release)
- Remove all MessageBox usage, hook up everything to display in the Shell
  view instead
- Would be nice to make Paymetheus.Decred a PCL again (Paymetheus.Bitcoin is
  in the btcsuite version), currently impossible because BlakeSharp requires
  the older .NET cryptographic libraries (low prio for windows desktop and
  maybe mono, but could be necessary for portability on other platforms).

View:

- [required] Should default to opening the overview frame
- [required] "sent" and "received" amounts in overview need to go, wallet
  does not track them and it would be more useful to put something like
  "locked" for those who stake
- [required] Request view doesn't hide UI elements depending on whether a
  generated address is shown yet or not
- [required] Bindings for history
- [required] None of the (post-startup) dialogs are working correctly.
  Most are missing their views, while others are just being displayed with
  many layout issues are are unusable.
- [post-release] Bindings for unspent outputs
- Offer to start dcrd for the user at beginning of startup dialog (if found
  in the PATH), to avoid the need to run the process separately.  No RPC
  credentials will need to be manually entered by the user since everything
  will be known by Paymetheus already.
- Time since last block has no binding and there is no easy way to access
  this yet for blocks already processed before starting the wallet.
  Might be wise to remove this in the first release.
- Textbox for amounts and destination strings in create transaction view
  need restyling.
- Some text is too small, make it bigger
- In create transaction view, the type of output needs to be selectable
  (such as paying to a raw script instead of an address), viewmodel already
  supports this.
- Still lots of hardcoded positions with margins in the new views.  These
  need to be repositioned relative to other objects (using Grid, StackPanel,
  DockPanel, Border, etc.).  Most of these are probably in the transaction
  history view since i haven't gotten around to binding it yet.
- Way too much duplicated xaml all over the place.  All common styles should
  be put in <Application.Resources>.
- Block hash of current block is no where to be found.  For desktop (mouse)
  users it might be adequate to use a tooltip over the block height, but
  this is a bad solution to those with touch screens.
- Add/remove output buttons in create transaction view need restyling
