RPC:

- New gRPC APIs to:
  - purchase tickets
  - anything else?
- Update existing messages for stake related fields (cj has full list)

Model/ViewModel:

- Don't save every transaction in memory (can fix post-release)
- Imported account is already hidden since it will be removed in a later
  dcrwallet release.  Decide if this needs to be displayed in first release
  or not.
- Fee estimation needs to be ported (partially completed in a btcsuite
  Paymetheus PR: https://github.com/btcsuite/Paymetheus/pull/44).
- Add viewmodel for history
- Add viewmodel for unspent outputs
- Remove all MessageBox usage, hook up everything to display in the Shell
  view instead

View:

- Time since last block has no binding and there is no easy way to access
  this yet for blocks already processed before starting the wallet.
  Might be wise to remove this in the first release.
- Should default to opening the overview frame
- "sent" and "received" amounts in overview need to go, wallet does
  not track them and it would be more useful to put something like
  "locked" for those who stake
- Need a textbox-like control for inputing amounts, to use in create
  transaction view.
- Request view doesn't hide UI elements depending on whether a generated
  address is shown yet or not
- Some text is too small, make it bigger
- In create transaction view, the type of output needs to be selectable
  (such as paying to a raw script instead of an address), viewmodel already
  supports this.
- Still lots of hardcoded positions with margins in the new views.  These
  need to be repositioned relative to other objects (using Grid, StackPanel,
  DockPanel, Border, etc.)
- Way too much duplicated xaml all over the place
- Bindings for history
- Bindings for unspent outputs
